# RadioLog
Small console based app for radioamateurs (HAM radio ethusiasts) to keep track of their connections easily and safely on their own PC. 

## Goals
* Fast UI to render and navigate.
* All in one binary, no external libs needed for runtime
* Multiplatform
* Common storage for ease of migration (sqlite)

## Notes
Project is in super early stage and at least for now it is intended for my own use and partially as interesting project to improve my Rust knowladge. 
Feel free to try it out but no guarantees are provided ie use on your own risk of data loss.
